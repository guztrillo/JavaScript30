# JavaScript 30 - Video Speed Controller

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Video Speed Controller


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

Kind of a rework from the earlier video player project. This time just focusing on the speed rate. Still really useful to learn how to work with```offset``` properties.
