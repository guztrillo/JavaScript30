# JavaScript 30 - Slide in On Scroll

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Slide in On Scroll.


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

Practice a bunch of window screen properties, which was a little confusing. I had to console.log a lot to really understand how it worked. But It was a great challenge.
