# JavaScript 30 -  JS and CSS Clock

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - JS and CSS Clock.

### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

For this challenge, I practiced a little of Dates and some CSS properties. Some things were interesting:

- You can change transform origin with ```transform-origin``` property, from 0% to 100%. Default value is 50%.

- Yo can reset styles just by applying ```Element.style.Property = ''```.
