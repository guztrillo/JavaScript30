# JavaScript 30 -  CSS Variables

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - CSS Variables.

### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

For this challenge, I practiced a little of DOM and CSS variables manipulation. I didn't know about some couple of things I never use before:

- The data attributes are more useful that I knew. Manipulating variables just by using ```dataset``` and referencing the data-attribute just by dot notation was mindblowing somehow.

- ```documentElement``` references to the root node of the document.
