# JavaScript 30 -  Flex Panel Gallery

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Flex Panel Gallery.

### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

This challenge was fun. Again, CSS variables manipulation using JavaScript. Refreshing some things about Flexbox properties and animations just using ```transform```.
