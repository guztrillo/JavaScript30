# JavaScript 30 - Click and Drag

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Click and Drag


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

It seemed easy, but it was kinda tricky. I found it cool how it works just by using four event listeners. Again a lot of practice with ```offset``` properties.
