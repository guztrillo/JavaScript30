# JavaScript 30 - Key Sequence Detection (Konami Code)

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Key Sequence Detection (Konami Code).


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

The ```secretCode``` is 'wesbos'. Some array manipultation, still thinking about that ```splice``` method.
