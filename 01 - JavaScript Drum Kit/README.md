# JavaScript 30 -  Drum Kit

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Drum Kit.

### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML.
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

For this challenge, I practiced a little of key events. I changed a couple of things:

- Changed ```keycode``` (deprecated) for ```key```, so I modified data-key attributes.

- Fixed ```playing``` class when long press keys. Just added event ```transitioncancel```.
