# JavaScript 30 - Fun with HTML5 Canvas

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Fun with HTML5 Canvas.


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

Never worked with Canvas before, so this challenge was very useful and fun. I'm looking forward to develop my own paint web app.
