# JavaScript 30 - Geolocation

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Geolocation


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

Another interesting project, but a little limited due the lack of a proper device to try all the functions. I guess using a framework it would be better.
