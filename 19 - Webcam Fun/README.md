# JavaScript 30 - Webcam Fun

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Webcam Fun


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

Ok, this was a really big project, at least compared to the others. A lot of cool stuff I've never use before, so It was very helpful. Pixels manipulation to make filters was my favorite part.
