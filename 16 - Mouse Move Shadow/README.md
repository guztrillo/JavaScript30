# JavaScript 30 - Mouse Move Shadow

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Mouse Move Shadow.


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

A couple of things: 
- Didn't know about that ```contenteditable``` attribute.
- ```offsetX``` and ```offsetY``` still confuse me a little, but I'm sure that more practice with help a lot.
