# JavaScript 30 - Speech Detection

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Speech Detection


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

Again, I never worked with those methods before, but it's good to know it comes build in the browser. But, I have to say that the final result was a little messy, at least on my computer. Maybe my microphone isn't good enough.
