# JavaScript 30 - Speech Synthesis

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Speech Synthesis


### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

I thought it would be similar to the earlier voice project, but actually use ```SpeechSynthesisUtterance()```method I didn't know, which is great because I learned new things.
