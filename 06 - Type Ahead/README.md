# JavaScript 30 -  Type Ahead

This a solution to the JavaScript 30 - Type Ahead.

### Notes

- I didn't Change CSS nor HTML (default files).
- I only focused on JavaScript.

### What I learned

Ok, first real challenge. This time practiced a couple of Regex which I don't feel comfortable using it, but is great for practice. Also fetch some infomation from a json endpoint and added with DOM manipulation, more complex than earlier challenge days.
